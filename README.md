##Accell Center Tutoring Report App
#### Scala, Lift, Boostrap, MongoDB
Working app: http://txtback.co/tutors

Accell Center was a small tutor collective. The tutors helped lower income, at risk students. 

This app was a prototype to allow tutors to enter in notes from their sessions for storage and future reference. It was used for one session before the group went on hiatus.
